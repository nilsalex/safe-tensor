# safe-tensor

This repository contains several projects:

 * The Haskell library [safe-tensor](packages/safe-tensor) for dependently-typed tensor algebra
 * A compatibility layer with `sparse-tensor`: [safe-tensor-sparse-tensor-compat](packages/safe-tensor-sparse-tensor-compat)
 * An [example project](examples/example) demonstrating the usage of the `safe-tensor` library for calculations
 * A highly experimental [example repl](examples/repl) as an attempt to create an interactive application from the library

The repository [linear-area-lagrangian](https://github.com/nilsalex/linear-area-lagrangian) contains a [real world application](https://github.com/nilsalex/linear-area-lagrangian/tree/master/haskell/ansaetze) in modified gravity research.
